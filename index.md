WHAT IS CONTINGENT EMPLOYMENT?
In todayâ€™s ODE (On-Demand Economy) You may have heard someone use the term agile workforce or contractor at work or seen it in a job posting. While in some ways there is a similarity to a contractor in the telecommunication field, in the corporate world it refers to temporary employees. Just like a subcontractor may be hired to complete a maintenance or repair problems, these temporary employees are commonly hired to complete a specific project. It is also known as contingent work.

What Is Contingent Employment? And Who Are Contingent Workers?

Known as independent contractors, contractors, temporary workers, freelancers or consultants, the contingent workforce differs from regular employees. They are not true employees of a company. Often hired through staffing agencies, they can be hired directly by the company.

In most cases these workers will be in customer service or operations, which are the areas where most of the volatility will be. Temps can be hired in other areas though. A marketing department may hire a freelance writer to help during a launch or a new product. Likewise, web designers may be hired on a contingent basis to redesign the website or employee intranet.
